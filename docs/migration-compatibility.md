# Official CC Connect migration compatibility

`cc-connect-next migrate` validates compatibility before creating or changing any target. The default `--source-version auto` does not execute a binary from daemon metadata; it validates the actual TOML schema, the same semantic requirements as normal startup, the configured Agent/platform registry, persistent-path inventory, source identity, and access metadata. Use an exact version when provenance is known, for example `--source-version v1.5.0`; unsupported explicit releases fail closed.

| Official source | Persistent layout | Configuration behavior | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1.4.1 | Covered | Covered | Supported |
| v1.5.0-beta.1 | Same known layout | Covered when every configured plugin exists in the Next build | Supported with preflight |
| v1.5.0-beta.2 | Same known layout | Covered when every configured plugin exists in the Next build | Supported with preflight |
| v1.5.0-beta.3 | Same known layout | `hide_agent_footer`, Feishu `mention_map` and `peer_bots`, topic workspace isolation, quoted-file retrieval, topic bootstrap, relay visibility, Weixin `burst_limit`/`burst_window_secs`, pi `thinking`, and the `cmd` array form are supported. The known rejections below fail preflight until implemented. | Supported with preflight |
| v1.5.0-beta.4 | Same known layout | Same strict configuration/plugin preflight; deferred settings below remain rejected. | Supported with preflight |
| v1.5.0-beta.5 | Same known layout | Same strict configuration/plugin preflight; deferred settings below remain rejected. | Supported with preflight |
| v1.5.0 | Same known layout | Full v1.4.1→v1.5.0 history was audited; configuration-specific gaps below fail before writes instead of silently changing behavior. | Supported with preflight |

Compatibility is deliberately configuration-specific. A release row does not mean an unavailable platform is silently removed or a new setting is ignored. If source TOML contains a field the current build cannot honor, fails normal startup validation (for example, an invalid display mode or a missing Agent/platform), or names a plugin unavailable in the current build, migration reports the exact incompatibility and writes nothing.

## Known rejections (fail preflight, nothing written)

- **Plugin types this build does not provide**: platforms `yuanbao`, `googlechat`, `tuitui`, `cloud_web`, `wps-agentspace`; agent `reasonix`. A source project configured with any of them is rejected by the registry preflight with the exact project and plugin name.
- **Gated settings implemented upstream but not here**: the `[[projects]]`-level `agent_session_idle_timeout_mins`, and the pi agent option `rpc` (official beta.x pi gained a persistent RPC transport; this build runs pi one-shot in json mode). An explicit `rpc = false` is behavior-neutral and passes.
- **Dynamic option tables are validated, not waved through**: the agent options `env` table migrates only for agent types that actually consume it (`devin` and `tmux` ignore env, so an env table on them is rejected as dead configuration). Feishu `mention_map` and `peer_bots` tables migrate only on `feishu`/`lark` platforms; `mention_map` additionally requires `resolve_mentions = true` and mention names without a leading `@` in this build, and the Feishu validator reports the exact violation otherwise. (Official CC Connect leaves a `mention_map` dormant when `resolve_mentions` is off; this build treats that as dead configuration and fails preflight with the fix.)

## What the report names

Migration is byte-faithful and rewrites exactly one value, the top-level `data_dir`. Three things that a byte-faithful copy cannot resolve on its own are reported instead, by both `--dry-run` and the real run:

- **Both source roots, when they differ.** `--source` is the directory holding `config.toml`, which is not always where the state lives: a config that omits `data_dir` uses the official default `~/.cc-connect` no matter where it was loaded from. When the effective `data_dir` is elsewhere, the summary names both (`config from … , state from …`) so the copied files are never attributed to the wrong directory.
- **Configuration values that still point at the source.** Any other absolute path — a wrapper `cmd`, a plugin directory, a `state_dir`, a log file — keeps referring to the official installation after migration. These cannot be rewritten safely because they may belong to third-party tooling with its own layout, so migration lists their key paths (never their values, which can carry credentials) and you update them before retiring the source.
- **Entries under a custom `data_dir` that are not CC Connect state.** A configured `data_dir` is not always a directory the product owns alone. Unrecognized entries are skipped, never copied, and listed. A `data_dir` holding no recognizable state at all is still refused, because then the setting itself is wrong.

## Defaults that differ from official CC Connect

A migrated configuration keeps its bytes, so every setting it does not spell out follows this build's defaults. These defaults deliberately differ:

- **`card_mode` defaults to `rich`** (the privacy-first Feishu Card 2.0 answer-card contract) where official CC Connect defaults to `legacy` plain messages. A migrated config that never set `card_mode` changes rendering. Set `card_mode = "legacy"` globally under `[display]` or per project to keep the official look.
- **`data_dir` defaults to `~/.cc-connect-next`** instead of `~/.cc-connect`. Migration removes the ambiguity for migrated configs by pinning the rewritten `data_dir` to the migration target explicitly.
- **The chat surface defaults to the final answer plus a compact status footer when no display mode is configured**: `thinking_messages`, `tool_messages`, and `show_context_indicator` are `false`, while `reply_footer` defaults to `true`. Set `reply_footer = false` globally or per project to hide it. A spelled-out `mode` keeps its official meaning, so a migrated config that set `mode = "full"` still gets thinking and tool messages, and `mode = "compact"` / `"quiet"` still hide them. Per-key values always win over the mode-derived default.
- **Feishu/Lark `done_emoji` defaults to `"Done"`** (official: no completion reaction). Set `done_emoji = "none"` to disable it. An explicit `reaction_emoji = "none"` already covers the completion reaction, so a migrated config that opted out of reactions stays silent.
- **`language` defaults to `"zh"`** (official: auto-detect from user messages). Set `language = "auto"` for the official detection behavior or pick a language explicitly. Regional spellings (`zh-CN`, `en-US`, `ja-JP`, …), casing, and surrounding whitespace resolve to the matching language; a value no language matches still falls back to detection and logs a warning at startup.

Feishu topic isolation is deliberately **not** an upgrade-time default change: an existing or migrated config that omits `thread_isolation` still gets the compatibility fallback `false`. Only a newly generated Starter config, or an operator who explicitly accepts the recommended Feishu profile, receives `thread_isolation = true`; either config can spell out `false`. When enabled, isolation applies only to real Feishu topics whose events carry `thread_id`; ordinary messages and non-topic replies in the main group chat retain the legacy per-user/channel session boundary and do not create topics.

Everything else — including Feishu `progress_style` (`legacy`), `reaction_emoji` (`OnIt`), the Weixin send quota (4 per 24h), and all timeout defaults — matches the official values.

The generated manifest is schema version 2 and records `source_version` as either the caller-supplied canonical release or `auto-layout-v1`, together with every copied file's source, target, size, and SHA-256.

## Recommended commands

```bash
cc-connect-next migrate --dry-run
cc-connect-next migrate --switch
```

When the official release is known:

```bash
cc-connect-next migrate --source-version v1.5.0 --dry-run
cc-connect-next migrate --source-version v1.5.0 --switch
```

`--switch` handles service order, final synchronization, Next activation, and rollback. It requires no installed Next service and must run outside a connected CC Agent session. Repeat every custom path/version option from the dry run.

Official and Next may remain installed together, but must not establish concurrent Feishu connections with the same app credentials. If the report listed configuration values that still point at the source, update them before removing the official directory — the migrated installation keeps using it until you do.
